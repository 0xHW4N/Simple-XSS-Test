1. Download the index.php file from your GitHub repository to your local computer.
<br>
2. Create a directory called "uploads" in the same directory as your index.php file.
`mkdir uploads`
<br>
3. Create a file called "messages.txt" in the same directory as your index.php file.
<br>
4. Change the permissions of the "uploads" directory and the "messages.txt" file to 777 to allow read, write, and execute permissions for everyone.
`chmod 777 messages.txt` `chmod 777 uploads/`

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to run your PHP code and test it for XSS vulnerabilities.
